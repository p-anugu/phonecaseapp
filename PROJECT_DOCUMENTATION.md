# Phone Case Design & Manufacturing Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project is a sophisticated web application that bridges the gap between creative design and manufacturing automation. It enables users to create custom phone case designs through AI-generated artwork or personal image uploads, then automatically converts these designs into manufacturing-ready DXF files suitable for CNC laser cutting machines. The system leverages cutting-edge AI technology (OpenAI's DALL-E 3) for design generation, combined with industrial-grade image processing pipelines to ensure designs are optimized for physical production. This end-to-end solution democratizes custom phone case creation by handling the complex technical conversion processes that typically require specialized CAD software and expertise.

## Core Functionality

### 1. **AI-Powered Design Generation**
- Integrates OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API to generate custom artwork from text prompts

### 2. **Image Processing Pipeline**
- **Multi-format Support**: Accepts PNG, JPG, SVG, GIF, and BMP image uploads
- **Preprocessing Engine**: 
  - Applies threshold filtering for binary conversion
  - Implements edge detection algorithms (morphology EdgeOut Diamond)
  - Despeckles and smooths images for cleaner vectorization
  - Color quantization for complex images (posterization)
- **Vectorization**: Uses Potrace algorithm to convert raster images to vector paths
- **Format Conversion Chain**: Image → PBM → SVG → DXF

### 3. **Manufacturing Integration**

- File upload handling with validation middleware
- Static file serving for generated designs

## AI Tool Usage Examples

### DALL-E 3 Integration
```javascript
// Example prompt enhancement for manufacturing-ready designs
Original prompt: "Lion face"
Enhanced prompt: "Centered minimalist black continuous line art symbol. 
                 Single unbroken black path on a plain white background. 
                 Clean vector-style drawing with no shading, no gradients, 
                 and no fills. Subject: Lion face"
```
